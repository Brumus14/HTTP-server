# HTTP-server
A Linux HTTP server programmed from scratch in C with no external libraries.

Currently the server can host static websites without a backend and I may update the project to add backend support and some other features listed in todo.txt.

The project is programmed purely in C and supports Linux, no external libraries have been used and only require C standard libraries and Linux headers.

Here is a demo of the server hosting my personal website.
