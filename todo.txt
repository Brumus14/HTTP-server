headers:
    Connection

return 404 page
handle all status codes
maybe case insensitive headers
chunked transfer

sanitize request:
    file path abuse

maybe DoS protection
connection limit
polling instead of forking
sendfile instead of reading file etc

dynamic configuration so that can properly handle POST request etc, would act like a website backend
could implement lua scripting for the config
